|desc = The prince of Irogu of the country of the great fox spirit. He is Saiga's older brother, and holds the power of the temple to bring rain. Being of a lineage of longevity, his age seems to have passed over 2000 years. His youthful looks draw people to remark how cute he is, which makes him angry. He is always being teased by his younger brother Saiga.
|bg = You, who were called to the Irogu of the country of the great fox spirit at Koga's invitation. Adorable on first sight, even as he plays around with you, you spend a fun time together, but an insurgent threatening to break temple boundaries appears...
