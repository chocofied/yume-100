Since he was raised with care inside the castle, in order for him not to leave the castle, he has never once seen a female. Since he's ignorant in the ways of the world, his personality is the pure type that basically believes anything people say.
|bg = Invited by Kanoto's messenger, you who were called to Kuyou. When you go out together with Kanoto, who has never ventured outside of the castle, the distance between your hearts begins to narrow...-
